# Daffo-House-Rent-SWE-Course-Project-
This is my software engineering course's project. A web application called Daffo House Rent is made for solving Housing Issue of the student of Daffodil International University. made with Python ,Flask 

User stories describe the requirements from the perspective of the end-user.
Student (General): "As a DIU student, I want to search for housing specifically near the Smart City campus so that I can minimize my daily commute."
Student (Budget Conscious): "As a student, I want to filter properties by 'Bachelor Mess' or 'Seat' and set a maximum price limit so I can find accommodation within my monthly budget."
Landlord: "As a local homeowner in Ashulia, I want to list my empty flat with photos and rent details so that university students can easily find and contact me."
1. Process Model Chosen: 
Agile Methodology (Iterative Model)
We chose the Agile Iterative Model for the development of Daffo House Rent.
Reasoning: Student housing needs change rapidly, and user feedback is critical. Agile allows us to develop the core features (Search, Login) first and then iterate to add advanced features (Filters, Profile Management) based on testing by the team
